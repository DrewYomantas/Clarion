            <p>
              Effective date: March 6, 2026. Last updated: March 27, 2026. Clarion collects account details, authentication and security metadata,
              billing metadata, uploaded CSV contents, generated report records, action items, and related operational
              logs needed to run the service.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
              <li>Account data can include email address, firm name, login events, and team membership details.</li>
              <li>Uploaded data can include review dates, ratings, comments, and any other fields present in your CSV.</li>
              <li>Generated data can include themes, complaints, praise, scores, PDFs, action plans, and governance signals tied to your workspace.</li>
            </ul>

        </article>

        <article className="trust-section">
          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-slate-900">How Clarion Uses Data</h2>
          <div className="trust-section-body">
            <p>
              We use your data to authenticate users, enforce plan limits, process billing, validate CSV uploads,
              generate governance reports and workspace records, support PDF export, send transactional emails, and
              operate support and security workflows.
            </p>
            <p>
              Clarion currently uses deterministic analysis and workflow logic to structure feedback into governance
              outputs. Billing is processed by Stripe. Partner-brief delivery and transactional email depend on
              configured email providers in the deployment environment, and we do not sell customer data.
            </p>

        <article className="trust-section">
          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-slate-900">Retention, Deletion, and Requests</h2>
          <div className="trust-section-body">
            <p>
              Active reports remain in your workspace until you delete them or we process an account closure request.
              Deleted reports move to Recently Deleted and are scheduled for automatic purge after 30 days. Free
              workspaces do not have restore access unless paid restore access is added during that window; Team and
              Firm workspaces can restore deleted reports within current plan permissions and history limits.
            </p>
            <p>
              Clarion does not currently provide a self-serve full account deletion workflow on the public site. For
              export, deletion, correction, or privacy questions, contact{" "}
