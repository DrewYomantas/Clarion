# Clarion Project State

_This file reflects current live state. Historical detail lives in `CHANGELOG_AI.md`. Design direction and product identity live in `NORTH_STAR.md`. Working rules and protected systems live in `AI_WORKING_RULES.md`._

---

## Startup Reads (Every Session)
1. `NORTH_STAR.md` — product identity, design direction, canonical brief spine
2. `PROJECT_STATE.md` (this file) — live state, architecture map, current pass
3. `AI_WORKING_RULES.md` — pass discipline, protected systems, build rules

## Repository Structure
- `backend/` — Flask monolith, APIs, services, templates, pdf_generator
- `frontend/src/` — React/TypeScript/Vite SPA (marketing + authenticated workspace)
- `Clarion-Agency/` — Agent office runtime, per-division agents, memory, execution layer
- `automation/calibration/` — Calibration pipeline scripts
- `data/calibration/` — Calibration inputs, synthetic reviews, run outputs
- `docs/` — This doc set (NORTH_STAR, PROJECT_STATE, AI_WORKING_RULES, CHANGELOG_AI)
- `tools/` — Smoke test helpers, seeded workspace tooling

## Major Subsystems (Verified File Paths)
- Feedback ingestion: `backend/app.py`, `frontend/src/pages/Upload.tsx`
- Governance signal engine: `backend/services/governance_insights.py`
- Calibration: `automation/calibration/`, `backend/services/benchmark_engine.py`
- Brief/PDF output: `backend/pdf_generator.py` + report PDF routes in `backend/app.py`
- Action tracking: `frontend/src/pages/ExecutionPage.tsx` + action APIs in `backend/app.py`
- Landing: `frontend/src/pages/Index.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/landing/`

---

## Current Phase

Release-candidate ready. Operator smoke passed. V3 landing active. Authenticated UX aligned around the governance brief as center of gravity. All brief output surfaces (on-screen, PDF, email) use the canonical 5-section spine.

**Active focus:** narrative continuity tightening (signals page, reports list next). Domain cutover to `clarion.co` pending.

Last completed UX pass: `2026-03-21 - Landing Modern-Motion Polish Pass`.

## Canonical Brief Section Spine (Locked)

```
1. Leadership Briefing
2. Signals That Matter Most
3. Assigned Follow-Through
4. Decisions & Next Steps
5. Supporting Client Evidence
```

**Surface alignment status:**
- On-screen brief (`ReportDetail.tsx`) — canonical, source of truth ✓
- Email preview modal (`EmailBriefPreviewModal.tsx`) — aligned ✓
- Inline email HTML (`emailHtmlSummary`) — aligned ✓
- Backend Jinja2 email template (`partner_brief_email.html`) — aligned ✓
- PDF reference layout (`PdfDeckPreview.tsx`) — aligned ✓
- Backend PDF generator (`pdf_generator.py`) — heading strings aligned ✓
- Still split (acceptable): backend PDF sub-labels (Exposure & Escalation, Execution Summary, Since Last Brief) are internal operational labels within canonical sections — not competing spine

## Active Pass

_None in progress. Last completed: 2026-03-21 - Landing Modern-Motion Polish Pass._

---



**Calibration engines are separate:**
- `backend/services/benchmark_engine.py` — used by `/internal/benchmark/batch` (live calibration path, all phrase/guard changes go here)
- `backend/services/bench/deterministic_tagger.py` — standalone harness only, not called by Flask

**Data layer:** SQLite with Postgres compatibility scaffolding. Render Postgres is production DB.

**Stack:** Flask monolith backend + React/TypeScript/Vite frontend. Deployed on Render. `https://law-firm-feedback-saas.onrender.com`.

## Operator Smoke State

Full local smoke pass confirmed 2026-03-18. Clean seeded Team workspace smoke confirmed same day.

Verified segments: login → CSV upload → report detail → signals → action creation → PDF preview → partner-brief email send.

Remaining non-blocking: large JS chunk warning in build (pre-existing), report brief text uses stored plan-at-run provenance (expected behavior).

---

## Calibration State (Stable — Hold)

Last fresh live run: `data/calibration/runs/20260317_223428`. Agreement rate 43.4% (62/143). Label variance confirmed as AI nondeterminism, not engine defect. Hold stable. Do not treat calibration as the main project story.

---

## Public Surface State

- `/` — V3 landing, governance-brief-centered hierarchy: hero → trust → workflow → outputs → accountability (dark anchor) → meeting → final CTA (dark)
- `/demo/reports/:id` — canonical public proof artifact (sample governance brief)
- `/demo` — secondary mechanics proof, explicitly framed as such
- `/features`, `/how-it-works`, `/pricing`, `/security`, `/privacy`, `/terms` — React-owned, share editorial shell
- Legacy Flask templates remain fallback/archive-only for overlapping routes

---

## Authenticated Surface State

Route structure unchanged and correct:
- `/dashboard` — current-cycle staging surface, brief-first
- `/upload` — single-CSV cycle entry point
- `/dashboard/signals` — evidence layer
- `/dashboard/actions` — follow-through accountability, brief-descendant framing
- `/dashboard/reports` + `/dashboard/reports/:id` — brief system, canonical artifact

WorkspaceLayout: sidebar nav labeled "Current cycle" / "Workspace settings". Topbar page notes are brief-oriented per route.

---

## Domain Cutover Checklist (Pending)

When ready to move to `clarion.co`:
- [ ] Render custom domain configuration
- [ ] Stripe webhook URL update
- [ ] Resend domain verification
- [ ] Frontend `VITE_API_BASE_URL` update
- [ ] CORS allowed origins update in `backend/app.py`

---

## Last Completed Pass
2026-03-21 - Landing Modern-Motion Polish Pass

- Added lightweight IntersectionObserver-based section reveals for the landing only
- Polished hero entrance pacing so copy and the governance brief preview settle with a calmer stagger
- Added restrained hover and press polish to public nav, CTA, and landing card surfaces

## Active / Next Passes
1. **Signals page** (`/dashboard/signals`) — audit whether it reads as governance-cycle evidence or detached data list
2. **ReportsPage** (`/dashboard/reports`) — brief list presentation quality
3. **Domain cutover** to `clarion.co` (checklist below)
4. Legacy Flask template retirement (if deploy constraints allow)
