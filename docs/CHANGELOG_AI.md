# AI Pass Changelog

## 2026-03-26 - Pass 12 - Landing / Marketing Proof + Onboarding Clarity + Launch-Readiness Truth Test

### Commit
- `9b6202e` - design: tighten launch-facing landing and first-run clarity

### Files Changed
- `frontend/src/components/landing/LandingHeroSection.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/landing/LandingOperatingPreview.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/landing/LandingWorkflowSection.tsx`
- `frontend/src/content/landingV3.ts`
- `frontend/src/pages/Onboarding.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/Upload.tsx`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

### What Changed
- Tightened the public buyer narrative so Clarion reads as a law-firm governance brief workflow rather than generic analytics software:
  - Landing hero now leads with partner-meeting clarity, decision visibility, and named follow-through.
  - Workflow and output framing now stress one review-period export becoming one readable governance record.
  - Public proof notes and preview framing now put the sample brief and the current governance brief ahead of generic workspace language.
- Clarified first-run onboarding so the user understands what Clarion creates before Clarion asks for file action:
  - Step 2 now explains the governance brief, client-issues record, and follow-through outcome first.
  - Step 3 now names the required CSV fields more clearly and frames the upload as the first review cycle.
  - Completion state now opens into the first governance brief when a file was uploaded during setup.
- Clarified the upload-to-brief path in the authenticated upload flow:
  - Upload page now explains the result as the current review packet: governance brief, client issues, and follow-through.
  - File picker language now matches the single-export workflow and no longer implies multi-file use at first run.
  - Success state and next-step copy now steer the user into the review packet first and point public proof to the sample brief.

### Explicitly Not Touched
- No backend logic changes.
- No governance engine, calibration, or PDF changes.
- No reopening of completed dashboard redesign work.
- No pricing, checkout, or route-contract changes.

### Verification
- `npm run build` in `frontend/` - passed (1822 modules).
- Shell-based Playwright runtime checks passed on:
  - landing page (`/`)
  - sample brief (`/demo/reports/26`)
  - authenticated upload page (`/upload`)
- Limitation: `/onboarding?preview=true` redirected the local smoke user to `/dashboard`, so onboarding preview-mode copy was verified in code/build but not as a direct runtime route.
- Pre-existing warning remains: Vite chunk-size warning (~910 kB JS bundle), unchanged in nature.

### Launch Verdict
- Near-ready with limited blockers.
- Public product understanding is strong enough for launch evaluation, but public launch should wait for deployed-environment truth: Render reconnect / stale deploy resolution, deployed smoke confirmation, and verification that setup-dependent delivery paths match production reality.

## 2026-03-26 - Pass 11 Ã¢â‚¬â€ Dashboard Tier 3 Rhythm Finalization + Authenticated Continuity Copy Lock

### Commit
- `ebc3c41` Ã¢â‚¬â€ design: finish dashboard tier 3 rhythm and workspace continuity copy

### Files Changed
- `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/SignalsPage.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/ExecutionPage.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/ReportsPage.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/governance/GovernanceBriefCard.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/WorkspaceLayout.tsx`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

### What Changed
- Finalized Dashboard Tier 3 rhythm with layout compression:
  - Paired `SinceLastReview` and `Escalations and watchpoints` in a shared `xl` two-column row.
  - Kept the same data and interactions; changed layout rhythm only.
  - Tightened escalations subtitle to partner-attention language.
- Locked authenticated continuity copy with minimal text-only updates:
  - Signals: `Needs Action` tab relabeled to `Needs Partner Attention`; triage section/empty-state copy aligned to the same phrase set; stale `All Signals` mention corrected to `Current Cycle`.
  - Execution: `Assigned to me` relabeled to `My follow-through`; matching section/empty-state language aligned to brief-record framing.
  - Reports + GovernanceBriefCard: prepare CTA labels standardized to `Prepare meeting brief` / `Prepare partner meeting brief`.
  - WorkspaceLayout topbar notes for Dashboard, Signals, and Reports rewritten to artifact-first meeting-ready guidance.

### Explicitly Not Touched
- No backend changes.
- No meeting-mode behavior or logic changes.
- No route, API, state, or data-contract changes.
- No edits to ReportDetail, governance engine, calibration, or PDF internals.

### Verification
- `npm run build` in `frontend/` Ã¢â‚¬â€ passed (1822 modules).
- Runtime smoke via Playwright on authenticated flow (`/dashboard` -> Signals -> Follow-Through -> Briefs -> Brief detail) confirmed:
  - Dashboard Tier 3 row pairing renders correctly.
  - Meeting view still toggles and renders correctly.
  - Updated labels/copy appear in live authenticated surfaces.
- Pre-existing warning remains: Vite chunk-size warning (~909.87 kB JS bundle), unchanged in nature.

## 2026-03-26 - Pass 10 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â Dashboard Tier 2 / Tier 3 Tightening

- `frontend/src/components/dashboard/GovernanceNarrativeRail.tsx`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

### What Changed
- Compressed Tier 2 framing and reduced equal-weight panel noise while preserving workflow and data:
  - Removed redundant suggested-actions section header wrapper.
  - Capped dashboard suggested-actions display to top 2 items.
  - Retreated suggested-action button treatment from primary to secondary and tightened button copy.
  - Placed `Follow-through to review` and `Recent follow-through` into a shared `xl` two-column row.
- Tightened supporting-tier rhythm and framing:
  - Shortened divider copy (`Attention now`, `Supporting cycle context`, `Workspace reference`).
  - Grouped `OversightBand` + `GovernanceNarrativeRail` into a shared `xl` row to reduce vertical drag.
  - Kept `RecentGovernanceBriefs`, `SinceLastReview`, and `Escalations and watchpoints` intact as supporting context.
- Softened secondary surfaces without changing behavior:
  - `GovernanceGuidance`: tighter subtitle/label copy, CTA moved to secondary style.
  - `OversightBand`: reduced heading emphasis, value size, tile padding, and gap density.
  - `GovernanceNarrativeRail`: reduced metadata/card density and typography emphasis.

### Explicitly Not Touched
- No backend changes.
- No meeting mode / `partnerMode` logic changes.
- No changes to Reports, Execution, Signals, or ReportDetail pages.
- No API contract, fetch logic, or route logic changes.

### Verification
- `npm run build` in `frontend/` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â passed (1822 modules).
- Pre-existing chunk-size warning remains (909.73 kB JS bundle), unchanged in nature.

## 2026-03-24 (continued) - Pass 9 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â Meeting Mode Elevation

### Commit
- `76536c9` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â design: meeting mode elevation ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â partner briefing framing, readiness card, stat labels

### Files Changed
- `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

### What Changed
Five targeted copy and label changes inside the `partnerMode` conditional block only. No structural, logic, or behavior changes.

- **Primary card eyebrow**: `"Meeting view Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· current governance brief"` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ `"Partner briefing Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· current governance brief"` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â drops the UI-label prefix (`Meeting view Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â·`) in favour of the artifact mode it actually is.
- **Positioning line above stat tiles**: added a `col-span-full` intro line ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â `"The partner-ready record for this cycle. Review the brief, confirm follow-through state, and carry this into the room."` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â grounds the stat tiles as pre-meeting readiness context rather than a summary widget.
- **Secondary card eyebrow**: `"Cycle attention"` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ `"Pre-meeting readiness"` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â names the card as the check you run before the partner discussion, not a generic status label.
- **Stat tile labels**: `"Open actions"` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ `"Open follow-through"` Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· `"Overdue"` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ `"Overdue items"` Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· `"High-severity signals"` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ `"High-severity issues"` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â governance-framed labels consistent with the rest of the workspace, removes task language from a briefing surface.
- **Readiness gate line after stats**: added `"Resolve overdue and unowned items before opening the brief in the meeting."` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â gives the stats directional meaning as a readiness gate, not just a count display.

### Verification
- `npm run build` clean. 1823 modules. Pre-existing 907kB bundle warning unchanged.
- No backend changes. No TypeScript type changes. No logic or behavior changes.



### Commit
- `5a1591a` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â design: report detail header ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â artifact-first sub-copy, send partner brief button promoted

### Files Changed
- `frontend/src/pages/ReportDetail.tsx`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

### What Changed
Two targeted changes. No structural, logic, or API changes.

- **Header sub-copy**: `"Use this packet for partner review, action decisions, and follow-through updates for the current cycle."` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ `"The governance brief for this cycle ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â the partner-ready record of what clients said, what the firm is doing about it, and what still needs a decision."` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â replaces task-description language with artifact-positioning language. The page now opens with a statement of what it *is*, not what you can *do* with it.
- **"Send partner brief" button**: promoted from `gov-btn-secondary` (same visual weight as "Download PDF") to a dark-border tier ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â `border-[#0D1B2A] bg-white font-semibold text-[#0D1B2A]`. The artifact delivery action now reads as clearly above the export utility. Toolbar hierarchy is now: (1) Present brief ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â dark fill primary, (2) Send partner brief ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â dark border secondary, (3) Download PDF ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â neutral secondary, (4) Add follow-through ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â quiet tertiary.

### Verification
- `npm run build` clean. 1823 modules. Pre-existing 907kB bundle warning unchanged.
- No backend changes. No TypeScript type changes. No logic changes.



### Commit
- `7e02fd1` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â design: execution page governance-cycle framing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â posture card, brief context, PageWrapper copy

### Files Changed
- `frontend/src/pages/ExecutionPage.tsx`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`

### What Changed
Six targeted copy-only changes. No structural, logic, or API changes.

- **PageWrapper eyebrow**: `"Follow-through"` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ `"Assigned Follow-Through"` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â matches Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â§3 of the canonical brief spine exactly, tying the page directly to the governance artifact.
- **PageWrapper description**: replaced generic task-state framing with artifact-first framing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â leads with what the page is (the brief's follow-through record), then what to do.
- **Posture card label**: `"Current follow-through posture"` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ `"Follow-through posture for this cycle"` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â grounds the card in the current cycle rather than a free-floating status.
- **Posture card h2**: `"Keep the current cycle credible before the next partner review."` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ `"What needs partner attention before the brief goes into a meeting."` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â partner-meeting framing rather than internal-ops framing.
- **Brief context card label**: `"Current brief context"` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ `"Current governance brief"` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â names the artifact directly.
- **Brief context card copy**: rewritten to make the directional link explicit ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â follow-through status feeds into the brief, not just "aligned."
- **Tab "firm-wide" label**: `"All follow-through"` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ `"Brief record"` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â names the default tab as the artifact's record.
- **Default-tab section sub-copy**: opening sentence anchors the view to the brief before the directive copy.

### Verification
- `npm run build` clean. 1823 modules. Pre-existing 907kB bundle warning unchanged.
- No backend changes. No TypeScript type changes. No logic or filter changes.


## 2026-03-21 - Landing Narrative-First Visual Modernization Pass

### Files Changed
- `frontend/src/pages/Index.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/SiteNav.tsx`

- `frontend/src/components/landing/LandingOperatingPreview.tsx`
- `frontend/src/index.css`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

### What Changed
- Tightened landing visual hierarchy while preserving the existing narrative spine and section order.
- Increased first-glance premium contrast with stronger landing-specific surface treatment (hero framing, card depth, workflow rail paneling, and clearer nav interaction states).
- Rebalanced hero composition so the governance brief artifact carries more visual authority without changing product meaning or CTA structure.
- Kept motion restrained and compatible with the existing reduced-motion behavior.

### Verification
- `npm run build` in `frontend/` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â passed
- Pre-existing non-blocking warning remains: Vite large chunk size warning

## 2026-03-21 - Docs-System Hardening + Codex Operating Contract Pass

### Files Changed
- `docs/NORTH_STAR.md`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/AI_WORKING_RULES.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

### What Changed
- Tightened doc-role boundaries so each core doc has one explicit responsibility.
- Reduced duplication in `PROJECT_STATE.md` by removing repeated repository/subsystem blocks and retaining a single authoritative live-state map.
- Added an explicit docs-system contract and stricter Codex execution rules in `AI_WORKING_RULES.md` (ownership confirmation, diagnosis-first, runtime verification requirement, and stop/report when cause is unconfirmed).
- Added a recommendation-only lane format for tool/connector/workflow opportunities with explicit approval required before adoption.
- Replaced live phase text in `NORTH_STAR.md` with a boundary rule that keeps current-state tracking in `PROJECT_STATE.md`.

### Verification
- Docs-only pass (no application code changed, no build required)

## 2026-03-21 - Landing Modern-Motion Polish Pass

### Files Changed
- `frontend/src/pages/Index.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/SiteNav.tsx`

- `frontend/src/index.css`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

### What Changed
- Added a lightweight landing-only IntersectionObserver reveal pass so hero and section content enter with restrained fade-and-rise motion.
- Tuned hero entrance pacing so the eyebrow, headline, supporting copy, CTA row, and governance brief preview settle with a cleaner premium rhythm.
- Added restrained hover and press polish to public nav links, public CTA surfaces, and landing cards without changing the underlying narrative or route structure.
- Added reduced-motion fallbacks so all landing reveals and hover transforms collapse to static presentation when motion reduction is preferred.

### Verification
- `npm run build` in `frontend/`

## 2026-03-21 - Landing Hero Refinement Pass

### Files Changed
- `frontend/src/components/landing/LandingHeroSection.tsx`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

### What Changed
- Refined the landing hero with a slightly wider editorial text measure, calmer headline scale, looser headline leading, and more vertical breathing room between the eyebrow, headline, body copy, CTAs, and supporting proof notes.
- Rebalanced the hero grid so the left narrative column feels less compressed while the right-side governance brief preview keeps its visual authority.
- Preserved the existing headline, CTA hierarchy, route structure, and product framing. This was a typography-and-layout pass only.

### Verification
- `npm run build` in `frontend/`

## 2026-03-19 - Governance Brief Output Unification Pass

### Files Changed
- `frontend/src/components/reports/EmailBriefPreviewModal.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/ReportDetail.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/pdf/PdfDeckPreview.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/DashboardPdfPreview.tsx`

- `backend/pdf_generator.py`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

### What Changed
- Aligned all brief output surfaces to the canonical 5-section spine established by `ReportDetail.tsx`:
  Leadership Briefing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Signals That Matter Most ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Assigned Follow-Through ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Decisions & Next Steps ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Supporting Client Evidence

**EmailBriefPreviewModal.tsx**
- Swapped tile order so Decisions & Next Steps (Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â§4) appears before Supporting Client Evidence (Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â§5), matching canonical brief order.

**ReportDetail.tsx**
- Swapped `<tr>` row order in `emailHtmlSummary` inline HTML so Decisions & Next Steps precedes Supporting Client Evidence.

**partner_brief_email.html**
- Relabeled `Metrics` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ `Leadership Briefing`
- Relabeled `Top Client Issue` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ `Signals That Matter Most`
- Added explicit `Decisions & Next Steps` section label (was `Recommended Discussion`)
- Added explicit `Supporting Client Evidence` section label (quote was previously embedded unlabeled inside Top Client Issue section)
- Changed header eyebrow from `Clarion Client Experience Brief` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ `Clarion Governance Brief`
- Changed header title from `Partner Briefing Summary` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ `Partner Governance Brief`
- Changed CTA text from `Open Full Dashboard` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ `Open Governance Brief`

**PdfDeckPreview.tsx**
- Added `PdfPreviewDecision` type and `decisions` prop
- Added `Decisions & Next Steps` render section between Assigned Follow-Through and Supporting Client Evidence
- Restored missing closing `</div>` tag dropped during prior partial edit

**DashboardPdfPreview.tsx**
- Passed `previewDetail.recommended_changes` mapped as `decisions` prop to `PdfDeckPreview`

**pdf_generator.py** (heading strings only ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â no logic changed)
- Replaced 5 agenda items with canonical section names
- Replaced `Firm Risk Posture` h2 with `Leadership Briefing`
- Replaced `Governance Signals Summary` h2 with `Signals That Matter Most`
- Replaced `Required Decisions` h2 with `Decisions & Next Steps`
- Replaced `Open Governance Actions` h1 (execution page) with `Assigned Follow-Through`
- Removed 6th agenda item (`- Client Signals`) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â canonical spine has 5 sections

### Verification
- `npm run build` in `frontend/` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â passed (pre-existing large-chunk warning remains non-blocking)
- `python -m py_compile backend/pdf_generator.py` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â PARSE_OK

### What Remains Split
- Backend PDF sub-labels (`Exposure & Escalation`, `Execution Summary`, `Since Last Brief`) are internal operational labels within canonical sections ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â not competing section spine, acceptable
- Inline email summary (`emailHtmlSummary`) covers 4 of 5 sections ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â no Assigned Follow-Through row, acceptable for summary format
- `pdf_generator.py` still uses `Exposure & Escalation` as a sub-heading within the Leadership Briefing section ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â deeper data-plumbing unification deferred

### What Changed

**Pass 1 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â Meeting Mode + Approval Queue gate (d95877d)**
- `partnerMode` conditional in Dashboard.tsx was rendering null ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â added the brief-first meeting view block (brief card, PDF button, 3-stat row, cycle attention strip).
- Approval Queue gated at three layers: WorkspaceLayout nav (sidebar item hidden for non-admin), App.tsx route (AdminRoute wrapper), ApprovalQueuePage defense-in-depth check. Law firm users cannot reach `/dashboard/approval-queue`.
- Date/time display confirmed correct ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â `toLocaleString` already uses browser local timezone, no bug.

**Pass 2 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â Dashboard token language (49f7cba)**
- Suppressed anchored-to metadata strip (cluttered, low value).
- Renamed brief card title to "Current governance brief".
- Removed PartnerBriefPanel (80/100 score contradicts posture label ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â needs engine audit before showing again).
- Cleaned "Brief handoff" label copy.

**Pass 3 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â Brief card first-viewport anchor (5a83f3d)**
- Brief card promoted to full-width first-viewport element.
- Removed `xl:grid-cols` side-by-side layout from Tier 1 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â FirmGovernanceStatus now renders below the brief, not beside it.
- Dashboard.tsx only.

**Pass 4 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â FirmGovernanceStatus visual weight reduction (8ccd5d2)**
- Title: `text-base font-semibold text-neutral-900` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ `text-sm font-medium text-neutral-500`
- Status badge: `px-4 py-2 text-base font-semibold` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ `px-3 py-1 text-sm font-medium`
- All 4 metric counters: `text-[36px] font-bold` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ `text-[24px] font-semibold`
- Subtitle reworded: "Supporting posture context for the current brief."
- FirmGovernanceStatus.tsx only.

**Pass 5 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â Reports/brief library elevation (733fe87)**
- ReportsPage eyebrow: "Leadership Artifact" ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ "Governance Brief Library"
- Description: generic feature copy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ artifact-authoritative copy
- Section label: "Current brief library" ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ "About this library"
- Section h2: generic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ "The governance brief is the primary artifact of each review cycle."
- Body copy: rewritten to position current brief as canonical, archive as reference
- Stat block: removed usage-meter "This month / plan limit" ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ replaced with "Latest" date stat
- Tab label: "Upcoming Meetings" ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ "Current Brief"
- Active brief eyebrow: "Prepared for next meeting" ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ "Active governance brief"
- GovernanceBriefCard: "View brief" promoted to primary dark CTA; "Download PDF" demoted to secondary; `isPast=false` card gets `border-t-2 border-t-[#0EA5C2]` top accent stripe.

### Verification
- All passes: `npm run build` clean. 1823 modules. Pre-existing 906kB bundle warning.

## 2026-03-24 (continued) - Signals Page Evidence Layer Reframe

### Commit
- `7929bbe` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â design: signals page reframed as governance-cycle evidence layer

### Files Changed
- `frontend/src/pages/SignalsPage.tsx`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`

### What Changed
Signals page framing updated so the page reads as the evidence layer feeding the governance brief, not a generic data table or review surface.

- Eyebrow: "Review Surface" ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ "Client Feedback Evidence"
- Description: rewritten to position page as evidence source behind each governance brief
- Framing section h2: changed from directive ("Start withÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦") to descriptive ("Recurring client feedback patterns from [date] ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â the evidence this governance cycle is built on")
- Tab "All Signals" ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ "Current Cycle" (default tab)
- Tab "Triage" ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ "Needs Action"
- Section label for default tab: "Issue queue" ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ "Current cycle evidence"
- Sub-copy for default tab: reframed around governance-cycle purpose ("These are the patterns the governance brief is built onÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦")
- Sub-copy for needs-action tab: updated to connect to brief finalization workflow
- Bottom attribution: "Based on: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦" ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ clean italic provenance line ("Evidence sourced fromÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ cycle datedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦")

No structural, logic, or API changes. SignalsPage.tsx only.

### Verification
- `npm run build` clean. 1823 modules. Pre-existing 906kB bundle warning unchanged.

- docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md

### What Changed
- Refined partnerMode in Dashboard meeting view to feel presentation-grade and artifact-first without changing logic.

- Polished the secondary readiness block with mirrored readiness badge treatment and promoted exit control to a secondary button.
- Preserved all existing data flow, APIs, route behavior, and partnerMode toggle persistence.

### Verification
