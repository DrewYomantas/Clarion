# AI Pass Changelog

## 2026-03-21 - Landing Modern-Motion Polish Pass

### Files Changed
- `frontend/src/pages/Index.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/SiteNav.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/landing/LandingHeroSection.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/landing/LandingTrustSection.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/landing/LandingWorkflowSection.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/landing/LandingOutputsSection.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/landing/LandingAccountabilitySection.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/landing/LandingMeetingSection.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/landing/LandingFinalSection.tsx`
- `frontend/src/index.css`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

### What Changed
- Added a lightweight landing-only IntersectionObserver reveal pass so hero and section content enter with restrained fade-and-rise motion.
- Tuned hero entrance pacing so the eyebrow, headline, supporting copy, CTA row, and governance brief preview settle with a cleaner premium rhythm.
- Added restrained hover and press polish to public nav links, public CTA surfaces, and landing cards without changing the underlying narrative or route structure.
- Added reduced-motion fallbacks so all landing reveals and hover transforms collapse to static presentation when motion reduction is preferred.

### Verification
- `npm run build` in `frontend/`

## 2026-03-21 - Landing Hero Refinement Pass

### Files Changed
- `frontend/src/components/landing/LandingHeroSection.tsx`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

### What Changed
- Refined the landing hero with a slightly wider editorial text measure, calmer headline scale, looser headline leading, and more vertical breathing room between the eyebrow, headline, body copy, CTAs, and supporting proof notes.
- Rebalanced the hero grid so the left narrative column feels less compressed while the right-side governance brief preview keeps its visual authority.
- Preserved the existing headline, CTA hierarchy, route structure, and product framing. This was a typography-and-layout pass only.

### Verification
- `npm run build` in `frontend/`

## 2026-03-19 - Governance Brief Output Unification Pass

### Files Changed
- `frontend/src/components/reports/EmailBriefPreviewModal.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/ReportDetail.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/pdf/PdfDeckPreview.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/DashboardPdfPreview.tsx`
- `backend/templates/partner_brief_email.html`
- `backend/pdf_generator.py`
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `docs/CURRENT_BUILD.md`
- `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`

### What Changed
- Aligned all brief output surfaces to the canonical 5-section spine established by `ReportDetail.tsx`:
  Leadership Briefing → Signals That Matter Most → Assigned Follow-Through → Decisions & Next Steps → Supporting Client Evidence

**EmailBriefPreviewModal.tsx**
- Swapped tile order so Decisions & Next Steps (§4) appears before Supporting Client Evidence (§5), matching canonical brief order.

**ReportDetail.tsx**
- Swapped `<tr>` row order in `emailHtmlSummary` inline HTML so Decisions & Next Steps precedes Supporting Client Evidence.

**partner_brief_email.html**
- Relabeled `Metrics` → `Leadership Briefing`
- Relabeled `Top Client Issue` → `Signals That Matter Most`
- Added explicit `Decisions & Next Steps` section label (was `Recommended Discussion`)
- Added explicit `Supporting Client Evidence` section label (quote was previously embedded unlabeled inside Top Client Issue section)
- Changed header eyebrow from `Clarion Client Experience Brief` → `Clarion Governance Brief`
- Changed header title from `Partner Briefing Summary` → `Partner Governance Brief`
- Changed CTA text from `Open Full Dashboard` → `Open Governance Brief`

**PdfDeckPreview.tsx**
- Added `PdfPreviewDecision` type and `decisions` prop
- Added `Decisions & Next Steps` render section between Assigned Follow-Through and Supporting Client Evidence
- Restored missing closing `</div>` tag dropped during prior partial edit

**DashboardPdfPreview.tsx**
- Passed `previewDetail.recommended_changes` mapped as `decisions` prop to `PdfDeckPreview`

**pdf_generator.py** (heading strings only — no logic changed)
- Replaced 5 agenda items with canonical section names
- Replaced `Firm Risk Posture` h2 with `Leadership Briefing`
- Replaced `Governance Signals Summary` h2 with `Signals That Matter Most`
- Replaced `Required Decisions` h2 with `Decisions & Next Steps`
- Replaced `Open Governance Actions` h1 (execution page) with `Assigned Follow-Through`
- Removed 6th agenda item (`- Client Signals`) — canonical spine has 5 sections

### Verification
- `npm run build` in `frontend/` — passed (pre-existing large-chunk warning remains non-blocking)
- `python -m py_compile backend/pdf_generator.py` — PARSE_OK

### What Remains Split
- Backend PDF sub-labels (`Exposure & Escalation`, `Execution Summary`, `Since Last Brief`) are internal operational labels within canonical sections — not competing section spine, acceptable
- Inline email summary (`emailHtmlSummary`) covers 4 of 5 sections — no Assigned Follow-Through row, acceptable for summary format
- `pdf_generator.py` still uses `Exposure & Escalation` as a sub-heading within the Leadership Briefing section — deeper data-plumbing unification deferred
