# handoff_contracts.md
# Clarion Agent Office — Inter-Division Handoff Contracts
# Version: 1.0 | 2026-03-12
# Agents may read. Agents may never modify.

---

## PURPOSE
Defines exactly when work passes from one agent or division to another.
A handoff that is not defined here does not happen automatically — it must be escalated.
Prevents dropped work, duplicate effort, and ambiguous ownership.

## HANDOFF 1: Lead Discovery -> Outbound Sales

trigger: Customer Discovery documents a named firm or contact with a qualifying signal (role match, pain signal, or engagement signal)

  - Firm name and public URL
  - Signal type (pain, engagement, role match)
  - Source URL (must be public)
  - Suggested outreach angle (1-2 sentences)
  - Confidence: low | medium | high
escalation_threshold: Escalate to Chief of Staff if signal indicates an inbound inquiry or a prospect has already reached out to Clarion
when_NOT_to_hand_off:
  - Firm is already in leads_pipeline.csv with status active or contacted

  - Trigger type (call request | pricing | pilot request)
  - How the signal was identified (source)

## HANDOFF FAILURE PROTOCOL
If a handoff payload is incomplete:
1. Receiving agent documents the gap in its report under HANDOFF FAILURES
2. Chief of Staff surfaces all handoff failures in the CEO brief
3. The work item is held — not dropped, not advanced with incomplete data
4. Sender agent must complete the payload on the next cycle
