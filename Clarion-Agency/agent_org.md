# Clarion — Internal AI Agent Organization Structure
# Version: 2.4

---

## Organizational Principle

Each agent represents a function a healthy SaaS company needs staffed.
Agents operate within their lane only. No agent has authority over another.
All agents report upward through the Chief of Staff.
