# FILE: backend/services/benchmark_engine.py
"""
services/benchmark_engine.py

Internal benchmarking engine for Clarion review-theme scoring.

RESPONSIBILITIES
----------------
1. Deterministic theme tagging/scoring with full intermediate evidence logging.
2. Optional AI benchmark pass via OpenRouter (disabled when OPENROUTER_API_KEY is absent).
3. Returns a structured BenchmarkResult dict containing both outputs side-by-side.

This module is ISOLATED from production scoring paths. It does not touch any
existing API contracts, DB schemas, or the live review_classifier pipeline.

USAGE
-----
    from services.benchmark_engine import run_benchmark

    result = run_benchmark(
        review_text="John never returned my calls and the fees were a surprise.",
        rating=2,
        review_date="2025-01-15",
        enable_ai=True,
    )

ENV VARS REQUIRED
-----------------
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY   -- OpenRouter API key (AI pass skipped when absent)
    OPENROUTER_MODEL     -- model slug, defaults to "openai/gpt-4o-mini"
    OPENROUTER_TIMEOUT   -- HTTP timeout in seconds, defaults to 20
